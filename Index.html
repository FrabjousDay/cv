      <h1>Rohan Millson</h1>
      <p><em>Historian of nutrition and medicine</em></p>
      <p>Researcher of human eating patterns and their associated health outcomes</p>
      <p>Author of <cite><strong>Why Animals Aren't Food</strong></cite>, volumes 1-3. (Amazon, 2016)</p>
      <p>I'm currently researching a fourth book, <cite><strong>The Low Carb Bullshit Artists Are Lying Us to Death</strong></cite>.
        Sadly, my progress is slow because Brandolini's Bullshit Asymmetry Principle applies: it takes at least an order of magnitude more time and energy to refute bullshit than it does to create it.
        <br><br>(<strong><cite>The Low Carb Bullshit Artists</cite></strong> features such dishonest and/or incompetent writers as Robert Atkins, Gary Taubes, Nina Teicholz and Tim Noakes.)</p>
      <p>I'm also collaborating with a splendid artist, Cornelia van Huysteen, on <cite><strong>Compassionate Eaters</strong></cite>,
        which describes many of the extraordinary historical figures down the ages who've foresworn animal-eating.
        <br><br>(Did their not eating animals make them great? Or did they not eat animals because they were great?)</p>
